## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to use R Markdown to create a web page. The web page should contain a map that is created using Leaflet. 

## Map Creation
Let's creat a map to show the headquarter of Coursera in Montain View, CA.

Based on the data from Google Map, the lattitude and longtitue of the Coursera headquarter are 37.787 and -122.061 accordingly.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
the_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=37.387, lng=-122.061, popup="Coursera")
the_map
```
